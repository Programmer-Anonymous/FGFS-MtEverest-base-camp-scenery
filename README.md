This is a custom scenery for FlightGear, adding some glow-in-the-dark runway markers for a made up runway and the corresponding .dat file just below Mt. Everest. 

### Installation

1. Download the repository as a zip or `git clone` it. Put the files in a location of your choice.
2. In FGLauncher, got to the `Addons` tab and add the location of the downloade repository (including `FGFS-MtEverest-base-camp-scenery` !!) to the list of `Custom Scenery locations`.
